# What are rain chains?
Rain chains control the flow of rainwater down to a manageable rate, which prevents erosion, heavy runoff, and waterlogging. Apon installation, you can collect rainwater during precipitation, which can be used to water plants, decreasing water costs.
## Instructions:
1) Install rain chain to your roof. 
2) Put a bucket/container below the rain chain.
3) Wait till it rains!
